# challenge-4-code-quiz

## Purpose
JavaScript's built-in Web APIs enable programmers to dynamically change the content of a page by selecting and appending elements declared within JavaScript at run-time. As such, this challenge requires the ability to display interactable elements, receive user input, and keep track of certain game conditions.
